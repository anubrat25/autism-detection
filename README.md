This project aims to develop a machine learning system for early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using behavioral and developmental data.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Prediction: Predict ASD likelihood on new data.
